# First npm alpha

Published on 2026-09-08 as [`@corbet-labs/cvld@0.1.0-alpha.0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@corbet-labs/cvld/v/0.1.0-alpha.0), with the `alpha` distribution tag. The unscoped `cvld` name was rejected by npm's similarity policy even though the registry returned no existing package. The repository and component name remain cvld.

The exact package was produced and consumed in [manual CI run 2](https://crow.corbet.ch/repos/11/pipeline/2), source `32c5416c6b0064de7d3b2122f7ee59438e45318c`. All 44 behavioral tests passed. A separate temporary consumer installed the actual tarball with lifecycle scripts disabled, explicitly installed the checksum-pinned native library, and exercised all five published import paths. The release contains 16 files and no cvld installation lifecycle hook.

After publication, the version metadata and package archive were retrieved anonymously from the registry. The downloaded bytes matched the tested SHA-256 and the registry's SHA-512 integrity value. Registry package-index responses briefly returned cached 404 responses while the version and archive were already available; publication verification used the version endpoint and actual archive.

The published cryptographic source, explicit native installer and browser test are unchanged from the earlier [Chromium virtual-authenticator run](https://github.com/corbet-labs/cvld/actions/runs/34258786567). The manual worker did not run a browser or mobile device. This alpha supports the documented Linux x64/glibc Node experiment; native mobile holder adapters, compatible live providers and production privacy guarantees remain incomplete. See the [README](../README.md) for installation and boundaries.
